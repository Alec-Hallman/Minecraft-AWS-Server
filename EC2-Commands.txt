EC2 Instance commands for post 1.18 Minecraft Forge servers.

Format:
- Anything with 2 "//" in front of it is an explanation for what the command is doing
- Anything with "$" in front of it is a command to be entered into the Ec2 Linux Terminal.

Commands:
$ mkdir /minecraft
//This is purely for organization, it's just creating a file, which keeps things nicely organized
$ cd /minecraft
//This command will put you inside your newly created Minecraft directory
$ aws s3 cp s3://<s3-Bucket-Name-Here>/Server-Files<Version>.zip /minecraft
//This line will import your s3 bucket server file into your ec2 terminal, this line is formatted like this: s3:// (this is the S3 URL to your Server-Files which can be found in your bucket) "/minecraft" is telling the computer to put
// your files in the /minecraft directory that was created
$ ls
// This is a very useful command and will tell you if you've done everything correctly so far, if you see your Server-Files zip when entering this command then everything is going according to plan.
$ unzip <Server-Files-Name-Here>
//This will inflate/unzip your server files
$ls
//again check your files and you should now see a Server-Files-<version> without the .zip, we want to enter this file.
$ cd <Server-Files-Folder-Found-In-ls-Command>
//This line will put us inside the Server Files folder
$ sudo startserver.sh
//this line will run the startserver file that should be located inside your Server-Files, while running this it will ask you to install Java, do that, and run it again,
& ./run.sh
//This line will actually start your server, and will take a few minutes, once it's done have fun!


If you'd like to backup your server run a command like this:
$ aws s3 cp --recursive /minecraft/<Server-Files-Folder>/world/ s3://<s3 URL to where you'd like to back up your world save to>
//This file will recursively put every world file into your desired s3 bucket location, this it's important to keep backups in case of a server crash.

To remove your would files you just need to overwrite the world files inside your Server-Files, the command should look something like this:
aws s3 sync s3://<s3 url to world backup folder> /minecraft/<server-Files-Version>/world/
