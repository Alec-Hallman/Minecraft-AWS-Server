Explanation:

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<s3 bucket url>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<s3 bucket url>/*"
            ]
This code here is applying an "Allow" is granting permission to the Action s3:ListBucket, s3:ListBucket allows you to list the objects inside the s3 bucket, not a necessary policy, but it's nice to have in case you want to verify that you've imported the right bucket.

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<s3 bucket url>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<s3 bucket url>/*"
            ]
This code grants permission to:

GetObject: allows you to retrieve data from items inside the s3 bucket
GetBucketLocation: allows you to see where the s3 bucket is located
PutObject: allows you to upload files to the s3 bucket
PutObkectACl: Allows you to control the access control list (ACL) of items in the bucket
DeleteObject: Allows you to delete objects from the bucket.
